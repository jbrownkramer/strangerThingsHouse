# Stranger Things House
This is the Code I Used To Implement strangerThingsHouse.com.  Go to strangerThingsHouse.com for more implementation details.

Stranger Things House was a Halloween decoration that I created for Halloween 2016.  I recreated, on my porch, the wall of letters that Winonna Ryder uses to communicate with her missing son in the show Stranger Things.  I had a live stream going 24 hours a day for two weeks.  Visitors to strangerthingshouse.com could enter message that would be displayed on the board.  Visitors to my house could text a phone number.
